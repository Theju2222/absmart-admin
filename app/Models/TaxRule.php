/**
 * WHAT a jurisdiction charges for a tax category.
 *
 * A rule is scoped to a country, optionally narrowed to one region, and optionally
 * to one tax category (NULL category = "everything not otherwise covered"). It holds
 * no rate of its own — the rate is the sum of its components, which is what lets
 * India express CGST 9 + SGST 9 and IGST 18 as two rules over the same 18%.
 *
 * A rate change is made by editing the rule; past orders keep the rate they were
 * charged because `order_item_taxes` froze it at order time.
 *
 * `place_of_supply`:
 *   any   — jurisdiction makes no intra/inter distinction (most countries)
 *   intra — seller region == buyer region
 *   inter — seller region != buyer region
